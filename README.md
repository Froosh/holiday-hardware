MooresCloud Holiday Hardware
==============

The Holiday controller is an open source hardware design, originally inspired by the [Olimex OlinuXino] (https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/iMX233/) - a Freescale iMX233 based embedded linux development board.

We used the OlinuXino iMX233 Maxi and Micro boards during development and testing of both the Light and Holiday, before designing our own custom PCB layout to suit the form factor and specific requirements.  The Holiday also incorporates an ATmega328 (running the "Arduino" environment) that communicates with the Linux environment for handling control during Linux boot-up and providing the tight timing requirements of sending data to the WS2812 LEDs.

The revision 2 hardware design is in Altium Designer (v13) format, and the Altium files along with the BOM, PDF, and gerber outputs are now available under the [Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license] (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/au/)
